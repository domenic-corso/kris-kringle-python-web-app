# Kris Kringle Web App with Python
A simple web app built with Python, [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) that can be used to help decide "who gives gifts for who" at Kris Kringle every year.

It also gives participants the ability to give hints to whoever got them üéÅ

## Creating a Dataset
In order for this app to have a use, we need to create a dataset which involves listing all participants (people involved in the Kris Kringle) and assigning them a **recipient** - who they need to buy a üéÅ for.

To do this, create a new terminal window, repeat Step 4 and run `python create_dataset.py Name1 Name2 Name3 Name4`.

For example, if Dom, John, Pete and Vanessa are involved in Kris Kringle, run this:
```sh
python create_dataset.py Dom John Pete Vanessa
```
If successful, you should see a list of URLs which each person needs to go to in order to access the application (and see their recipient).
